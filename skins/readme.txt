Put your skins inside of this /skins folder
under the name skin.png.

Other formats than PNG are not currently
supported, you can fork my project and add
support for them if you wish ;)

Your skin will be rendered either as a normal
Minecraft model or as if it was leaning
against a wall.
Or you can add your own render functions!
